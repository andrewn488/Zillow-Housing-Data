# Zillow-Housing-Data

Collaboration with Jordan Gropper

Used Zillow housing data on 21,000 sold homes to analyze market trend, produce Technical Appendix and Memo report. Worked with an associate to find recommendations and important factors. The Technical Appendix walks through the steps of basic and advanced EDA, then selects the most interesting visuals and trends for the memo. Both are exported as RMarkdown HTML files from Rstudio
